I work for Tencent as a software engineer. I received my degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Chengdu Information Engineering University. I would like to apply for the Master of Information Studies program at Trine university, because I am very interested in this program and hope to become an expert in this industry in the future. I know that your school has a very good major, is well-known in the industry, and has cultivated many elites in this industry, so I really want to be a member of your school and continue to improve in this professional field.

I have made a long and very extensive and thorough preparation for further study of this profession.

Even though I majored in EE in college, I discovered that CS piqued my attention more. I have gained a great deal of professional support through self-study, and I have a professional knowledge base that rivals that of CS majors. I started my job at an IT company after graduating with success. I developed my engineering expertise while working at my first firm, and I also learned a lot about cross-team teamwork and continuous learning research, which I later turned into patents. Through this process, I have developed some strong programming skills. I obtained employment with Tencent, a prestigious software firm, by consistently enhancing my skills. My team and I created a browser-based applet platform from the ground up in a world-class working environment, servicing hundreds of millions of browser users and expanding by millions.

My interests lie in information technology research and management, which are well suited to Trine's MSIS program. I have gained a better understanding of the curriculum of this program through communication with current alumni, and I believe it is a perfect fit for me. Despite my current limitations, I believe that with all of my enthusiasm and my studies in professional courses, this program at Trine will lead me into the field of information technology management, where I can develop my skills.
After finishing my studies at Trine University, I plan to pursue a career as a technical product manager, utilizing my strengths, honing my leadership skills, and overseeing the macro-level development of the technical team. In the future, I hope to launch my own company, share my knowledge and experience, and use technology to better people's lives.
